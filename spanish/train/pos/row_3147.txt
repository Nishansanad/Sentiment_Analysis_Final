Well,i'm not a movie critic or something like thatBut I have my opinion for this movieI think that the best in this movie was Amanda Bynes,she played her roll for my look very well,i have watched many her movies,this I liked most!When you are watching this movie,you just can relax,come down,and watch itYou don't have to try to look for subtext or something like thatYou just watch it Movie is really great Maybe I liked it for actress,maybe for all the scenery,but i liked itThe whole atmosphere that was createdIn one moment I just felt like I was in that university,in that roomIt is not another drama movie that is made to win Oscar,it is just nice movie to watch in your free time
