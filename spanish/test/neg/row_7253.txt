The plot was not goodThe special effects weren'tThe acting was not very good at allLike others, I felt there were numerous holes in the plot that you could fly, well, a space shuttle throughI thought the ending was rather unbelievableBy the way guys, about the "blow torch in space"Blow torches have their own supply of oxygen (Hence the name "Oxy-Acetylene torch") Two hoses run from the torch: One to an acetylene bottle and one to an oxygen bottleSo a "blow torch" would work just fine in space
