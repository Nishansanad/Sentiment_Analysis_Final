JJ Jameson (from Spiderman 2) Quote  Crap, Crap, Mega-Crap It pretends to be an homage (un/intentional) to the Coen Brothers  done poorlyThere is no real mystery to the plotDiaz's performance is totally uninspiredThe quirky characters don't really workThere are a lot of "duh" momentsI love black comedy, but this film isn't funnyIn my view, it wasn't worth the electricityThere are many films in this genre which are much more entertainingI hope you find this review helpful
