The original animated Dark Knight returns in this ace adventure movie that rivals Mask of Phantasm in its coolness There's a lot of style and intelligence in Mystery of the Batwoman, so much more than Batman Forever or Batman and RobinThere's a new crime-fighter on the streets of Gotham She dresses like a bat but she's not a grown-up Batgirl And Batman is denying any affiliation with her Meanwhile Bruce Wayne has to deal with the usual romances and detective work But the Penguin, Bain and the local Mob makes things little more complicatedI didn't have high hopes for this 'un since being strongly let down but the weak Batman: Sub Zero (Robin isn't featured so much here!)but I was delighted with the imaginative and exciting set pieces, the clever plot and a cheeky sense of humor This is definitely a movie no fan of Batman should be without Keep your ears open for a really catchy song called 'Betcha Neva' which is featured prominently through-outIt's a shame the DVD isn't so great Don't get me wrong there are some great features (the short 'Chase Me' is awesome) and a very cool Dolby 51 soundtrack but the movie is presented in Pan and Scan Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman was drawn and shot in 185:1 but this DVD is presented in 133:1 an in comparison to the widescreen clips shown on the features there IS picture cut off on both sides I find this extremely annoying considering Mask of Phantasm was presented in anamorphic widescreen Warner have had to re-release literally dozens of movies on DVD because people have complained about the lack of Original Aspect Ratio available on some titles Why they chose to make that same mistake here again is beyond meI would give this DVD 5/5 but the lack of OAR brings the overall score down to 4/5 It's a shame because widescreen would have completed a great DVD package
