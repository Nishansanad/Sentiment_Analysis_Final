I lost my father at a very young ageSo young in fact,that I have no recollection of himOver the years I have learned many things about him One of those things was that he loved westerns,and watching Bonanza every Sunday evening was an absolute ritual for himI,myself, remember the tail end of the series' run,having been 8 years old when the show ceased production in 1973Watching this show over the years somehow makes me closer to my long ago lost fatherIt has all the right elements to make a show successful;laughter,tears,edge of your seat suspense,and it even angered you at timesMy most vivid memory of the show's original run,came shortly after the death of our beloved "Hoss" Cartwright,Dan BlockerOne particular episode,and the end of the closing credits, flashed a picture of Blocker,and faded to black,and I can also recall my oldest sister with a tear in her eye at the sight of thisI can remember this as though it were yesterdayOn behalf of my late father, who is not here to say so himself,we love BonanzaLong live the Cartwrights
