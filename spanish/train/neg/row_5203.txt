Saw it at the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Film FestWhat can I say? Against my better judgment, I liked it, but it seemed to me that that acting was a littleweak (mostly I noticed this from the family of the teen boy) I mean, the script wasn't stellar to begin with, but the actors didn't make me believe the relationshipsThe plot is also predictableNonethelss, I liked it The characters are likable, and the plot is not challenging or upsetting It's sweet, the characters care about each other, and I don't count it as fifty minutes ill-spent But I don't recommend it
