A stunningly beautiful Charlotte Lewis stars as a woman who is terrorized by a ghosts who torment her on the phoneDriven to the edge in terror Charlotte is forced to confront this chilling mystery in order to save her sanity and her lifeI can't believe that Ruggero Deodato,the director behind "Ultimo Mondo Cannibale","Cannibal Holocaust" and "House on the Edge of the Park" directed this absurd piece of trashAdmittedly the music by Goblin front man Claudio Simonetti is pretty good,but the story is painfully stupidThe script by Franco Ferrini is ridiculous and it makes no sense,the acting is bad and there is absolutely no suspenseThe scene in which a prospective rapist of Charlotte Lewis is killed by coins ejected from a subway telephone is more than laughableDon't waste your time with this piece of crapThere are far better Italian horror movies out there!
