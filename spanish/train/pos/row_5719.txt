"Death Bed:The Bed That Eats" is a supremely bizarre horror film that truly has to be seen to be believedThere is an ancient four-poster bed that just loves to eat humans and it does so anytime it can lure anyone to lie upon itThere is also a long-dead artist,imprisoned behind one of his paintings,who provides a voice-over narrationGeorge Barry's the first and only one film offers some truly surreal moments such as the bed absorbing its victims in a mysterious sea of yellow foam and liquidThe atmosphere is dreamy and there is only a little bit of gore,unfortunately the premise is rather silly and the acting is amateurishStill as fan of unusual cinema I enjoyed this low-budget oddityGive it a chance8 out of 10
