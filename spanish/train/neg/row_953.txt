This movie is painfully slow and has no plot It conveys the lives of a group of laid off boatworkers One of the older ones is sincere in his attempt to get a job There may be some social commentary here, but, it is muddled as nobody is painted in a very sympathetic lightI do not understand why it had a 78 when I decided to watch it I watched the whole tedious thing and built expectations for a huge redeeming payoff No luck The IMDb rating has always been such a good match for my tastes Anything above 65 was worth watchingAnd my wife says Javier Barem does not even look good in this movie He's not my type, so, my agreement does not mean muchSigh I give it a 1
