I read nothing but good things about this movie and finally had a chance to watch it late last night and it was everything I expected it to be and moreThis is the way a proper horror movie should beI think the reason it was so scary was because it was so realistic The spooky sounding score was perfect for setting a dark moodI liked the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed how the rest of the movie played outIt was very easy to follow and understand unlike some movies which are way too complicatedThe special effects were very goodI would love to see more horror movies like this oneThis is easily one of my favorite'sA realistic thunder and lightning storm would have set a nice atmosphere for this movieOther then that it had all the elements a good horror movie needsI highly recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good scary movie that pulls no punchesI will be adding it to my collectionThe DVD has some interesting special features
