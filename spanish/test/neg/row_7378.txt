Very funny to watch "Beretta's Island" as kind of natural trash-filmIt is like answer to Jess Franko's type of b-movieBodybuilders strikes back (!face to face!) to pushersThe very very very stupid strike!Action: unbelievably bad directed firing(shooting) scenes look even better than hand-to-hand fightingChasing scenes ridiculousSaving beauties scenes incredibly stupidErotic scenes are very uneroticThe main luck of film is pretty landscapes and festival scenesDon't miss:Arnold Schwarzenegger's joke at start of film and list of Franco Columbu's kin at the end Special attraction: naked bosomAlmoust forgot - Franco can sing!
