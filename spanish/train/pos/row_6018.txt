This film is a classic seventies cop flick that for some reason has been sadly overlooked It is basically French Connection meets BullitRoy Scheider plays the head of an elite group of detectives, known as the "Seven Ups" One of their men is discovered during an undercover op and is killedScheider and his team must find his killers They become involved in a battle with the mobThe highlight of the film has to be the car chase, obviously included to cash in on the success of Bullit However, this car chase outshines Bullitt due to its length, speed and sheer excitementIt's a breathtaking roller-coaster ride that ends rather unexpectedly and spectacularly Don't miss this little gem !!
