This is one of the worst films I have seen in a whileThe problem is that it doesn't know whether it wants to be an intelligent political film, 'artistic' or an exercise is eroticism As a result it fails on all accountsThe acting is atrocious, the narration off putting and the supposed symbolism pointlessKlaus Kinski is probably the best thing about this film but that isn't a good thing Sure he has an intense and 'unique' look but ultimately he can't actually act Just look at how he reacts when his mistress leavesReally don't watch this film, some say it needs repeat viewings I say one is too many
