Of course you could never go into a theatre and witness the types of sets you get in this film From that point of view it is utter fantasy But who cares? It is certainly true that you will not find this film listed in with Citizen Kane, Battleship Potyomkin and all the other films the pseuds tell us we should be watching Films like this are worth a hundred Citizen KanesIt is about what cinema does best: great camera-work, great settings and great performancesThe three spectacular scenes at the end are probably best in the order they are presented, keeping the best till lastI will gladly watch this film again and again and again and
