I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movieThat is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at the moviesI LOVE the original and have seen it several times and recommend it to everyone This may have been the problem but I do not think so, because there were a couple of bright spots that showed if done right they could have made this movie workBette was under used and Anne was over used and miscastI do not know why English or anyone for that matter let this go out in that conditionThey billed this as a Sex in the City but better? Not a chance I liked Sex in the City a lot and was disappointed by this movieSo do not waste your money on this movie - go see anything but this!
