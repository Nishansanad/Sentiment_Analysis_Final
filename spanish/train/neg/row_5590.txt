I have not seen and heard the original versionI am no Russian, but I am learning right nowI also have no preferences for Russia, Bulgaia, the US etcBut what I have to mention is:In the German synchronisation in the whole film all Russians speak with Russian accent Americans talk "Hochdeutsch" (without accent)! I have never heard such a stupidity! Besides, this is boringI hope the original is betterThe rest is a simple thriller, not really good ideas Like a cheap version of a James Bond film
