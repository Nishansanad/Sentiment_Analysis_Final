Seems to have been made as a vehicle for WC Fields and Carol Dempster and they dominate it Fields already has his film character well developed Carol Dempster seems to dance through the film and her acting reminds me of Mary Pickford, who also worked a long time under DW Griffith Typical of later Griffith films technicallyLater remade as Poppy (the original title) with Fields in the same role
