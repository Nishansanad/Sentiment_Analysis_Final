It felt like I watched this movie thousand times beforeIt was absolutely predictableEvery time the story tried to get a bit twisted,every time I awaited something interesting to happen, I saw nothing but what I expected Like "The bread factory opened up another facility,because there was not enough bread" In two words:Flat story,that has become a clich√©,bad acting,bad special effectsOnly the dumb Russian cop,Vlad, was a bit funny while punishing around the bad guysThe pile of muscles was so incredibly STUPID,that it made me laugh at him for a moment I wonder why i waste my time spitting on that shame-of-a-movie It won't get worse (because it is not possible) :D
