I can't remember the worst film I have watchedTotal waste of actors and audience timeIf you prefer sitting by your TV and think when will be this film over,then this is the right film for youMaybe this film is recorded to make people believe that Moscow has some mystique past But I must say I have not expect anything else from Rade Serbedzija,but I have expected more from Vincent GalloThe film lacks a plot, character,development,denouementEntire movie is about underground tunnels and how they are mystiqueI must be fair there is some camera effect but even that is too poorOver and over are the same picturesTotal waste of time
