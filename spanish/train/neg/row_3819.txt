2 stars, and I'm being generous (minor spoilers) Look, this is a low budget zombie movie set in gangland Oakland As the plot goes, a scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after being killed in a drive-byThe main problem with this movie: what zombies?! All the "zombies" do is growl (which doesn't sound even remotely scary) and drip fake red blood from their mouths! No scary eyes, no decaying flesh, just a bunch of people growling pathetically and running around like idiotsThe cover is also misleading There are only about 6 zombies in the whole film, so it's not like the whole "hood" is plagued with zombies or anything, it's just a few, and is contained in no timeThe acting actually is so bad it's hilarious No one can act at all in this movie (except maybe one of the gang members) and it really seems like a bunch of friends got together, decided to cast their family, and made a movie one weekendFinal note: since when do Doctors wear tracksuits?! Skip this one, please!
