The only part lacking in this movie is Shue's part as the daughter wanting to follow in her "aunt's" footsteps as a daytime soap star Otherwise it would be a perfect 10It seems that every actor enjoyed their parts and overacting to fulfill their own enjoyment as well as the script - I have to wonder if a little ad lib'ing wasn't taking place in parts It was well cast and there are some classic lines that will stick with youIt's a fantastic movie everyone should see at least once I'd recommend not drinking anything that would sting coming out your noseYou'll definitely want to watch the last scene closely, 'Nurse Nan' has a little secret she'd rather not have shared with youIf you love daytime soaps or despise them, this move pokes fun in all the right places
