This was so bad, I want God to give me an extra two hours of life having had to sit through itFirst off, the acting was uniformly bad There was barely a plot, unless "Shaggy dog story with a guy in a rain poncho and skeleton mask instead of a dog" countsThe editing was was all over the place, and the slow-mo shots of the "gore" (red corn syrup flying through the air--doubtless flung using a spoon) got irritating after the tenth time, and infuriating after the hundredth timeI like Michael Rooker He's done some good work This was not good This was less than good And by that, I mean that it sucked HardFor god's sake, don't watch this movie
