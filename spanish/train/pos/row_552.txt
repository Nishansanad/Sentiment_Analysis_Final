This is a film that can make you want to see it again I especially, liked the way it ended I did not see the end coming, but when Laws was not blown away the first time, one suspects he will be back againThe story is gripping and could have been more psychological, but I understand the story needed to capture the viewer and the action was necessary for thatHard to believe Michael Jr could be so apparently unmoved as his younger brother and mother as blown away But, I can appreciate the scene play couldn't really take our attention there because it had a greater story to tellSome have complained about Hanks as a gangster I believe that isn't justified If his character had been any harder, he would not have cared if his son pulled a trigger or notEight Stars for this one Although it was released in 2002, I just saw it for the first time yesterday on DVD
